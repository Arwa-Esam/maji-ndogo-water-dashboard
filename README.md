🚰 Maji Ndogo – Water Access Dashboard (Power BI Project)
A Power BI dashboard analyzing water access conditions across the fictional country Maji Ndogo.
This project was completed as part of the ALX Data Analytics – Visualization Sprint, focusing on data storytelling, geospatial analysis, and actionable insights.

📌 Project Overview
This dashboard explores:
Accessibility of basic water services
Provinces with the highest upgrade needs
Budget allocation required to improve national water access
Key differences between rural vs. urban water sources
Major challenges faced by households in collecting water
The goal is to support data-driven decision making and highlight areas needing urgent improvements.

📊 Key Insights
✔ 1. Basic Water Access
Only 34% of the population has access to basic clean water.
Meaning 66% (≈18M people) still face water challenges.

✔ 2. Improvement Budget Needed
Total budget required: $146M+
Highest budgets:
Sokoto → $40.1M
Kilimani → $39.2M

✔ 3. Required Upgrades
Kilimani → 6700 upgrades
Sokoto → 5603 upgrades

✔ 4. Rural vs Urban
Rural areas rely on shared taps + wells
Urban areas rely more on in-home taps

✔ 5. Province Performance
Lowest access: Kilimani (28%)
Highest access: Amanzi (41%)

**💡 Recommendations
**1️⃣ Prioritize High-Need Provinces
Focus on Kilimani & Sokoto → high population + lowest access rates.

**2️⃣ Improve Rural Infrastructure
**Invest in:
shared tap networks
well maintenance
water-quality monitoring systems

3️⃣ High-Impact Repairs
Install RO filters
Fix broken taps
Reduce waiting times at crowded tap areas
