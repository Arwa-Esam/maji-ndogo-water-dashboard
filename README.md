# **Maji Ndogo – Water Access Dashboard (Power BI Project)**

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard analyzing water access conditions across the fictional country **Maji Ndogo**.  
The project focuses on **data storytelling**, **DAX modeling**, **GeoJSON mapping**, and translating survey data into clear insights.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

This dashboard answers key questions:

- **How many people have basic access to clean water?**
- **Which provinces require the highest number of upgrades?**
- **What is the estimated improvement budget (~$146M)?**
- **How do rural vs. urban populations differ in water access?**
- **What are the most common water sources across locations?**

---

## **📊 Key Insights**

### **1️⃣ Basic Water Access**
- Only **34%** of the population has basic access.
- That means **66%** (≈18 million people) still face water challenges.

---

### **2️⃣ Budget Requirements**
- Total improvement budget needed: **$146M+**
- Highest needs:
  - **Sokoto → ~$40M**
  - **Kilimani → ~$39M**
- Lowest:
  - **Amanzi → ~$13M**

---

### **3️⃣ Required Upgrades**
- **Kilimani → 6700 upgrades**
- **Sokoto → 5603 upgrades**
- **Amanzi → 3748 upgrades** (lowest)

---

### **4️⃣ Rural vs Urban**
- **Rural areas:** rely heavily on shared taps and wells.
- **Urban areas:** more use of in-home taps.

---

### **5️⃣ Province Comparison**
- **Lowest access:** Kilimani (28%)
- **Highest access:** Amanzi (41%)
- **National average:** 34%

---

## **💡 Recommendations**

1. **Prioritize investment** in high-need provinces (Kilimani & Sokoto).
2. **Improve rural infrastructure** — shared taps, wells, monitoring systems.
3. **Repair critical infrastructure** — broken taps, RO filters, contaminated wells.
